# Urban Strategies Council Site Launch Checklist
A checklist of miscellaneous tasks to do before launching a public website. 

## Usage
Make a new GitHub issue in your project called "Final Checklist" and copy/paste the following:


```
## Framing / Call to Action
- [ ] Make sure that the site has a clear call to action. This should not be 'hey look at this cool tool'. Rather, it should be a way for someone to engage in a meaningful way on the issue being presented.

Some examples:

* Join a mailing list (which means you need to create one)
* Attend an event
* Share on Facebook/Twitter
* Donate to a particular organization
* Create a Tumblr for people to share interesting findings (if it's a data access site)

## Google Analytics

* [ ] Create [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) account
* [ ] Hook up the GA Tracking Code (typically in our `analytics_lib.js` file)
* [ ] Set up relevant Goals and Funnels
* [ ] Set up [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en)
* [ ] Verify site in Webmaster Tools with DNS TXT record
* [ ] Link Webmaster Tools to Google Analytics

## Sharing & Rich Snippets

- [ ] Set up general meta tags
 * `<meta name=“description”>`
 * `<meta name=“author”>`
- [ ] Set up Facebook meta tags & validate [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
 * `<meta property=“og:site_name”>`
 * `<meta property=“og:title”>`
 * `<meta property=“og:type”>`
 * `<meta property=“og:description”>`
 * `<meta property=“og:url”>`
 * `<meta property=“og:image”>`
- [ ] Set up Twitter meta tags & validate [here](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
 * `<meta name=“twitter:card”>`
 * `<meta name=“twitter:site”>`
 * `<meta name=“twitter:creator”>`
 * `<meta name=“twitter:description”>` (note that this needs to be under 200 characters)
 * `<meta name=“twitter:title”>`
 * `<meta name=“twitter:url”>`
 * `<meta name=“twitter:image:src”>`
- [ ] Create 2-5 meme images using [Canva](http://canva.com/) or a similar tool

## Mobile Friendliness

Test on various mobile devices:
- [ ] scrolling is easy
- [ ] nav bar works
- [ ] hoverable things are tappable
- [ ] charts/maps look ok

Using localtunnel to test a site running locally:
1. `npm install -g localtunnel`
2. `lt --port 5000` (or replace 5000 w/ whatever port you're using)
3. navigate to the url that localtunnel gives you

## Load Testing

If your site relies on a database or server-side code, it should use caching and be load tested. If it's a static HTML or Jekyll site, you can skip this section.

- [ ] set up page [caching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache)
- [ ] write a script to load test all your pages. [Here's a good example from Illinois Sunshine](https://github.com/datamade/illinois-sunshine/blob/master/cache_builder.py)

## Readme

If the site is open source, make sure the Readme.md is complete and accurate. 

Here's a few good examples:

- [Geomancer](https://github.com/associatedpress/geomancer/blob/master/README.md)
- [Illinois Sunshine](https://github.com/datamade/illinois-sunshine/blob/master/README.md)

The Readme should have the following sections:

- [ ] Overview
- [ ] Setup
- [ ] Running locally
- [ ] Team
- [ ] Errors / Bugs 
- [ ] Pull Requests
- [ ] Copyright and License

## Outreach

- [ ] Write up press release
- [ ] Identify who will be the primary person of contact and make their info prominent on the website and all PR
- [ ] Identify relevant media contacts to email
- [ ] Identify relevant social news sites (reddit, listservs, slack channels)
- [ ] Divide & conquer - send out the media blitz!
```
